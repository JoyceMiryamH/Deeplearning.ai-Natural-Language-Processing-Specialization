# Deeplearning.ai's Natural-Language-Processing-Specialization
## My Courses Notes, Laboratories and Assignments

This repository contains my personal notes and completed assignments for the [DeepLearning.ai](https://deeplearning.ai) NLP specialization.

[DeepLearning.ai](https://deeplearning.ai)  contains four courses which can be taken on [Coursera](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/natural-language-processing). The four courses are:
1. [Natural Language Processing with Classification and Vector Spaces](https://github.com/ijelliti/Deeplearning.ai-Natural-Language-Processing-Specialization/tree/master/1%20-%20Natural%20Language%20Processing%20with%20Classification%20and%20Vector%20Spaces)
2. [Natural Language Processing with Probabilistic Models](https://github.com/ijelliti/Deeplearning.ai-Natural-Language-Processing-Specialization/tree/master/2%20-%20Natural%20Language%20Processing%20with%20Probabilistic%20Models)
3. [Natural Language Processing with Sequence Models](https://github.com/ijelliti/Deeplearning.ai-Natural-Language-Processing-Specialization/tree/master/3%20-%20Natural%20Language%20Processing%20with%20Sequence%20Models)
4. [Natural Language Processing with Attention Models](https://github.com/ijelliti/Deeplearning.ai-Natural-Language-Processing-Specialization/tree/master/4%20-%20Natural%20Language%20Processing%20with%20Attention%20Models)
